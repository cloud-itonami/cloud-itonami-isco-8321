  "MotorcycleDispatchActor — the ISCO-08 8321 community motorcycle
  courier dispatch actor as a `langgraph.graph/state-graph`
  (ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section). One graph run = one
  dispatch-coordination operation request (intake → advise → govern →
  decide → commit/hold, with a human-approval interrupt for escalated
  proposals). No infinite internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so
  an interrupted run can resume after human sign-off. This actor
  coordinates DISPATCH/LOGISTICS SCHEDULING ONLY — it never operates
  the motorcycle and never finalizes a route or traffic-navigation
  decision. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-3313's
  accountingsupport.actor / cloud-itonami-isco-8322's driving.actor.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the MotorcycleDispatchAdvisor can never
  directly commit a record the MotorcycleDispatchGovernor refuses —
  every commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide`, and a proposal
  that would finalize a route/traffic-navigation decision or override
  the rider's on-road safety judgment can never reach `:commit` at
  all (hard, permanent `:hold`)."
